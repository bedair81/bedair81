👋 Hey, I'm **Ahmed Bedair**, a machine learning and Python enthusiast studying at 🎓 **King's College London**.

I'm a strong believer in open source and the freedom it provides. I've been using powerful tools like TensorFlow and scikit-learn to tackle challenges in various domains, from strengthening cybersecurity to exploring other areas where ML can make a real impact. Python has been my go-to language, but I'm also diving into Rust to broaden my programming skills. 🐍🦀

Check out my projects to see how I'm using data to build smarter, more innovative solutions. I'm always eager to collaborate and push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

If you're interested in working together on exciting projects or just want to chat about the latest developments in ML and beyond, feel free to reach out. Let's create something amazing together! 💡
